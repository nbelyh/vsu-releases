# Visio Super Utilities Release Repository

This is releases repository for [Visio Super Utilities](https://unmanagedvisio.com/products/vsu).

**These are the utilities that were originally created by Paul Herber, UK.**
Paul decided to entrust me the maintenance and further development of the product. So, starting from version 3.8 the utilities will live here.

For the previous versions, please check out the [Paul Herber's website](https://www.paulherber.co.uk/visio-utilities/)
